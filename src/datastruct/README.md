# datastruct

A collection of general purpose data structure types and routines.

Everything in this module manipulates memory. It has no dependencies and
performs no I/O. It can be safely depended on as a non-mock library in tests.

`datastruct.h` exports all features. You can also depend on these headers
directly:

- `str.h` : Strings and string buffers
